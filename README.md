# Xenoblade-Chronicles-Tabletop-RPG

This is a non-developer project to create a Tabletop RPG guide for the Xenoblade Chronicles Game.

## Disclaimer

I own none of the material for this project. Xenoblade Chonicles is a game developed by Monolith Soft and owned by Nintendo, here is the [page](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-switch/) for the game. I also use the [Fandom wiki](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Xenoblade_Wiki) as a reference and source for some texts.

I built the rules based on in game mechanics and my experience with tabletop RPGs such as Wizards of the Coast's Dungeons & Dragons.

Most of the content in the present files ( other than the readme ) contain spoiler. If you haven't played the game I personally recommend giving it a try or even a full playthrough. You have been warned, discretion is advised.

## Guide for the guide

HoÃ¯ !

If you're reading this, you've probably wondered why this didn't exist yet. As of today I can only find one source for a similar attempt with menachanism oriented toward Warhammer battles : [Lasatar's Xenoblade Chronicles Tabletop Strategy Game](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Lasatar/Xenoblade_Chronicles_Tabletop_Strategy_Game.). This is a shame and I'm planning to give it an attempt with another outlook.

This game will be based on Tabeltop role playing games. Unlike Warhammer which is a battle simulation, a D&D style RPG is based on a story line and the actions of the players to create their own version of the story. That style will enable the players and Dungeon Master ( **DM** ) to go through the whole story of the Xenoblade Chronicles Game.

If you're reading this *again*, you will probably take on the role of the Dungeon Master. If not then please don't view any content past the readme but don't hesitate to check out the [teaser](#teaser) section ðŸ˜‰ ...

Alright MR. DM, I advise you to read the Rules once or twice before starting a play through. You should know where every useful rule is ahead of time. Depending on your eagerness, the player's speed going through the game and your DM skills you can read the Story chapter per chapter or as a whole. The Story is detailed in the Story folder, it contains a story line per chapter and locations descriptions & maps. Any necessary map for a chapter will be linked in due time.

Your are the dungeon **master** for a reason if anything I put in my rules isn't to your liking then please change it up the most important parameter is the player's fun ! You should also have a good time DMing this. If you make improvements of your own that you feel are pertinent then please open an issue on github describing your upgrade, you can use the [upgrade template](./Upgrade.md).

This Tabletop RPG is based off the actual game so you can watch the [Official trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfjVIQug6_E).
