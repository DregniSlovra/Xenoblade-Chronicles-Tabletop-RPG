During a fight, the players moves as they would anywhere else but with some differences.

- A hexagon is equivalent to 1 meter in diameter
- A player can move floored (**Speed**/10) turns per round
- Each entity (Player, Monster, Obstacle, etc) blocks an hexagon and no other entity can move through an occupied hexagon.
- An entity is facing one of the sides of the hexagon. They reach an enemy if it is in the hexagon in front of them or one on the sides unless mentionned otherwise.

## 2 Moving

The Overworld is the name given to the maps that represent wide open zones. Areas are smaller yet spacious zones such as the inner part of a city, every level of a cave or a remarkable landmark.

### 2.1 Turns

When moving through maps players will count Turns as they progress. Tiles on the map are represented by Hexagons, each is 1 turn in diameter.

1 turn is a third of a day, the first turn of the day is the morning, the first turn of the night is evening. Including morning & evening, a full Day/Night cycle lasts 6 turns in the Overworld and 12 turns in an Area.

### 2.2 Tiles

Tiles are hexagons, going through one hexagon takes 1 turn. There is no cutting down turns so going from one place to the other within a hexagon doesn't take a turn.

### 2.3 Encounters

Every time players travel for 1 or more turn you throw a die to determine what encounters they are going to make. When moving for more than 1 turn add the number of turns to the result of the die. Refer to the specific encounter table of an area to get the correspondance between your result and what happens next. Usually the higher the die the tougher the situation.

Waiting for a specific time of the day will count as travelling the same amount of turns and provoke an encounter.
