# The Light Swordman

## Description

The light swordman is a light unit oriented towards damage and positioning. It has a very polyvalent set of art. He's overrall weaker than other classes but can be useful in every situation.

Most of his arts revolve around positioning, often requiring other party members to draw attention away from him in order for his arts to deal their additional effects, which makes him weaker when fighting enemies head-on, as his arts require him to wait for openings.

The light Swordman is one of the lowest HP playable character, but his Strength and Agility greatly balance out this flaw.
