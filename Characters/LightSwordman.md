# The Light Swordman

## Description

Most of his arts revolve around positioning, often requiring other party members to draw attention away from him in order for his arts to deal their additional effects, which makes him weaker when fighting enemies head-on, as his arts require him to wait for openings.

The light Swordman is one of the lowest HP playable character, but his Strength and Agility greatly balance out this flaw.
