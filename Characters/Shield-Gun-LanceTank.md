# The Tank

## Description

As the name suggest this class acts mainly as a tank, being able to easily attract the attention of enemies and the ability to wield heavy armour and defense increasing Shield-gun-lance weapons. His high HP and the debuffs that some of his arts cause allows him to further improve his survivability against enemy damage. He is also gifted with multiple Aura abilities that can turn him into an offensive powerhouse, defensive target, or prevent himself from getting incapacitated, and is one of the two classes capable of Toppling and Dazing enemies quickly. This grants him excellent staying power and crowd control, which allows the other members of the party to rip into enemies without fear of retaliation.

However, as it is the designated "Tanking" character, it is reliant on healing to keep him on the front lines, often necessitating a healer to fight alongside him during tougher battles.
